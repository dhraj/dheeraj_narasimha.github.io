      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website. My name is Dheeraj Narasimha.
        I finished my PhD from Arizona State University under the guidance of Prof Lei Ying (currently at the University of Michigan) and Prof. Gautam Dasarathy.
        I then completed a PostDoc at Texas A&M University under the supervision of Prof Srinivas Shakkottai and then moved to Grenoble to do another PostDoc at 
        the LIG lab, INRIA at Grenoble under the supervision of Prof Nicolas Gast. 
        
        My main research extracts simple, nearâ€‘optimal structures from hard sequential decision problems. This includes simple model predictive algorithms for Weakly
        Coupled Markov Decision Processes (of whom the Restless Multi-Armed Bandit is a prime example) as well as extremely large games with weak interaction kernels.
        (Potential games and Mean Field Games). I have also been working on some online learning problems for communication networks and their use in LLM allignment.
